# Open Jam 2018 - Saber and Archer

1 Players = SPAM

20 Players = Super SPAM !!

A 20 Players Spamming mini Online Game!

## Problems

- Why can't the shots hit the enemy?

In order for the bow to hit the enemy, you need to move vertically so that you are at the same Z-axis level as the target.

Since there is no shadow, you may have difficulty judging the Z-axis position. I have added a shadow to v1.0.1.

- The game FPS is very low, I have a way to play it?

The web version requires higher computer performance to run, you can try the host version, and the situation should be greatly improved.

## About Online Mode

Online mode do not support with Web, please download and play with PC, Mac or Linux.
Since there are not many players, the online mode is likely to have no players. If you want to play multiplayer games, please send the game to your friends and let them join!
If you can choose, please let the player with better computer performance and network speed "Create Game". Other players "Join Game".

## About Infinite Mode

The number of enemies appearing in infinite mode depends on the performance of the computer. Under the premise of stable frame rate, the number of enemies will increase to the limit, usually in the range of 100 to 300.
